# Multiple_Views_in_Recyclerview
In this repository i have implemented  multiple view types inside one recycler view 
In the above demo i have shown two types of views i.e-
  1.Headings
  2.SubHeadings 
using single recycler view .
This concept is used in most of the apps that are around us like,whatsapp,flipkart,amazon.
For example if we want to create a chat application and we need to show different views in
one recycler view like Images,videos,audios,pdf,sender text on left/receiver text on right etc so to implement all these kind of functionlity inside one recycler view we use the concept of Multiple Views Inside a single Recycler view.
